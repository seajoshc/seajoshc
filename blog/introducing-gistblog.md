tl;dr [checkout Gistblog here](https://github.com/seajoshc/gistblog) 

I don't quite know what triggered it but one night in early November 2021 I decided that I wanted to start blogging every once in awhile again. It doesn't matter that few, if any, people will ever read the things I write. It's just a creative outlet. But regardless, as always I was paralyzed by all the choices I had for which blog platform/engine to use. 

I decided to just put my first post in a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to get the ball rolling, thinking I would move it elsewhere later. But then I thought it might be kind of cool to continue using Gists for blogging since it was so easy. I started looking more into the APIs and discovered that a workflow around blogging via Gists was definitely feasible (shoutout [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)). 

It also just so happened that the [2021 GitHub Actions Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/join-us-for-the-2021-github-actions-hackathon-on-dev-4hn4) was going on, so as any good developer does... I decided to make my own ~~Rube Goldberg machine~~ blog engine instead of trying to pick one! A few weeks later I am happy to introduce... [Gistblog!](https://github.com/seajoshc/gistblog) 

*Funny story, the hackathon is [hosted by DEV](https://dev.to/) which is actually a very lovely blog/social platform 😅 But it's all good, I'm entering the Whacky Wildcards category 🤣*

### What is Gistblog and why do I need it?

[Gistblog](https://github.com/seajoshc/gistblog#setup) is an opinionated GitHub repo setup that turns markdown into blog posts. Powered by the [Gistblog GitHub Action](https://github.com/seajoshc/gistblog-action#readme), your markdown is turned into wonderful [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) that can be easily updated and shared. [Here's my Gistblog](https://github.com/seajoshc) embedded into my GitHub profile README. The fancy markdown [table of blog posts](https://gist.github.com/seajoshc/d898750deca042b9b241ad8b79bcac96) is even generated by Gistblog!

Do you need a simple platform for sharing your thoughts and ideas with the internet? Have you ever wanted an easy way to turn some plaintext into a blog post? Don't care about things like SEO, monetization, or having a fancy looking website? Is "indefinitely free" your desired monthly cost of hosting your own blog where all the content is yours? Already a big GitHub fan? [Gistblog](https://github.com/seajoshc/gistblog#setup) is the blogging engine for you!

Follow the [setup guide](https://github.com/seajoshc/gistblog#setup) and Happy Gistblogging! 🎉
