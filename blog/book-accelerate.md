Book is basically a deep analysis of [State of DevOps Report](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=state+of+devops+report&ia=web) data and a bunch of insights that came out of that. 

High performers compared to low in 2017
- 46 times more frequent code deployments
- 440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy
- 170 times faster mean time to recover from downtime
- 5 times lower change failure rate (1/5 as likely for a change to fail)

Software Delivery Performance
- Lead Time
- Deployment Frequency
- Mean Time to Restore
- Change Fail Percentage
    - tl;dr this one is somewhat of an outlier, only the above 3 form a valid and reliable statistical "construct"

Good information flow is critical, duh

Team Dyanmics are still the most important thing, duh

[Westrum Culture](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture)
- Pathological - power oriented
- Bureaucratic - rule oriented
- Generative - performance oriented * spoiler alert you want this one

Continuous Delivery and Lean Management together impact culture in a positive way, these are the things to go after
