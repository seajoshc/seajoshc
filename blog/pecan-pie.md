# Pecan Pie

A pretty easy pecan pie recipe that just about anyone can do.

# Ingredients

1/3 cup butter, melted
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
3/4 dark corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional if using salted butter)
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1 tablespoon bourbon (optional)
8oz bag of pecans, halves or pieces OR 1 cup
1 pie crust, refrigerated, frozen, or your own

# Hardware

- Pyrex pie pan - link out
- Measuring cups
- Large bowl for mixing
- Aluminum foil

# Recipe

1. Pre-heat oven to 375F conventional bake.
1. Place room temperature pie crust inside 9in pie pan (pyrex recommended).
1. Melt the 1/3 cup butter. https://www.wikihow.com/Melt-Butter. Let it cool for a moment; not too long but also not piping hot for the next step.
1. Mix together melted butter, 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, 3/4 cup dark corn syrup, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon bourbon. Blend well, hand or stand mixer recommended. Should be silky smooth and light brown, if not somewhat grey, in color.
1. Mix approximately 1/3 of the pecans into the mix. Don't obsess over the amount.
1. Put approximately 1/3 of the pecans on the bottom of the crust. Again, don't obsess.
1. Pour the mixture into the pie crust.
1. Distribute the remaining 1/3 of the pecans on the top. If you want to get fancy, you can add even more pecans on top and try to arrange them in a pattern or even cover the entirety of the top of the pie for a really nice look.
1. Bake for 15-20 minutes, checking at the 15min mark. When the crust is starting to get a light golden brown color to it you want to pull it out and cover the edges in foil. Keep your oven closed to keep the heat in, be gentle as you pull out the pie don't let it splash around.
1. Bake for another 20-30 minutes until the center of the pie is set. What you are looking for is no movement at all from your pie. While it's still cooking, you will notice the center will jiggle around and be fluid. The longer it cooks the more solid it will get, you want to pull it out once it's set and no longer moving.
1. Cool for 30 minutes.
1. Now the hard part. Refrigerate about two hours. Bring to room temperature before serving.
