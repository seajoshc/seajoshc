# Pecan Pie

Hello internet, I wanted to share a pretty easy pecan pie recipe that just about anyone can do. There's so much sugary goodness that it still tastes good even if it doesn't come out perfect! If you try it out, let me know what you think.

## Ingredients

1/3 cup butter, melted
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
3/4 dark corn syrup
1/2 teaspoon salt (optional if using salted butter)
3 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
1 shot of bourbon (optional)
8oz bag of pecans, halves or pieces OR about 2 cups of pecans
1 pie crust, refrigerated, frozen, or your own

## Hardware

- 9in pie pan - I like pyrex but it doesn't really matter
- Measuring cups
- Large bowl for mixing, hand/stand mixer optional but recommended
- Aluminum foil

# Recipe

1. Pre-heat oven to 375F conventional bake.
1. Place room temperature pie crust inside pie pan.
1. Put approximately 1/4 cup of the pecans on the bottom of the crust. Don't obsess over the amount, you just want to cover most of the bottom of the crust with a small layer of pecans.
1. Melt the 1/3 cup butter. https://www.wikihow.com/Melt-Butter. While it's melting, you can move on to the next step if you'd like to starting getting the other ingredients prepared and into the mixing bowl (don't combine until the butter is ready though).
1. Mix together melted butter, 1 cup packed dark brown sugar, 3/4 cup dark corn syrup, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 shot of bourbon. Blend well, hand or stand mixer recommended. The mixture should be pretty thin and runny, smooth with few, if any, lumps, and light brown in color.
1. Fold in approximately 1/2 of the remaining pecans into the mix using a spoon. Don't obsess over the amount, whatever is left will go on top of the pie.
1. Pour the mixture into the pie crust.
1. Distribute the remaining pecans on the top. If you want to get fancy, you can add even more pecans on top and try to arrange them in a pattern or even cover the entirety of the top of the pie for a really nice look.
1. Bake for 15-20 minutes, checking at the 15min mark. When the crust is starting to turn a light golden brown color, you want to pull it out and cover the crust/edges in foil so they don't burn. Keep your oven closed to keep the heat in, and be careful as to not let the pie splash around when you pull it out as it will be very liquid still. To cover the edges, tear off a good size sheet of aluminum foil into four strips you can place around the pie crust. Don't worry if it's not perfectly on there, even just resting the strips on top in a square shape works fine tp keep the crust from burning.
1. Bake for another 20-30 minutes until the center of the pie is set. What you are looking for is no movement at all from your pie. While it's still cooking, you will notice the center will jiggle around and be fluid. The longer it cooks the more solid it will get, you want to pull it out once it's set and no longer moving.
1. Cool for 30 minutes.
1. Now the hard part. Refrigerate about two hours. Bring to room temperature before serving. Enjoy with cool whip, ice cream, and/or friends.
